HW 5
================

# Problem 1

  - fill in missing numeric values with the mean of the non-missing
    values

  - character variables, fill in missing values with “virginica”

  - writing a function that takes a vector as an argument

  - replaces missing values using rules defined above

  - returns the returning vector

  - applying this function to the columns of iris\_meaning\_missing
    using map statement

<!-- end list -->

``` r
replace_missing = function(x) {
  if (is.character(x)) {
    x=replace(x, is.na(x), "virginica")
  } else {
    mean_x=mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)
    x=replace(x, is.na(x), mean_x)
  }
}

output = map_dfr(iris_with_missing, replace_missing)

output
```

}

##trying this outside of the dataframe
